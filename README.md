3D Laser Scanner with Hemispherical Movements

# Description
The mechanical, software, firmware, and electrical design of a 3D laser scanner which can rotate along 2 axes to capture a hemispherical view.  

A user interface (Visual C#) allows user to control the movements of the laser scanner and monitor the images captured.  The user interface passes commands to TI-MP430 microcontroller to control the movement of a stepper motor and a servo motor.  Images captured by a mounted webcam is sent to the UI for processing and viewing. This user interface the passes the captured data to a secondary program (written in Processing) for point-cloud visualization.

The design of the laser scanner is completed in SolidWorks.  The frame of the laser scanner is waterjet cutted and the motor mounts are printed with a 3D printer.  

This project was completed by Arnold Yeung and [Albert Lagman](https://www.github.com/albertlagman/) and adapted and modified from Callan Mackay's project originally on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/3D-Environment-Laser-Scanner-From-Scratch/?ALLSTEPS).
